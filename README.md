# GraphNet
Graphnet is a javascript graph library that will be created as a module to the semantic UI framework. Whereas Graphnet dynamically renders all nodes and edges via websocket connections, node and edge positioning algorithms such as force, random, circular, and others must be provided within the Graphnet as builtin modules.


# An Approach How to Build GraphNet Library .
 
 1. **Define the functionality and API of the library :-**

     Before we start coding, first we need to decide what functionality the library will provide and how it will be used by developers.                                           This includes deciding on the data structures to use for representing graphs, defining the methods for adding and removing nodes                                         and edges, and deciding on the supported layout algorithms.

 2. **Implement the graph data structure:-**
        Once we've defined the API, we can start implementing the graph data structure. We'll need to decide on a representation for nodes and                                   edges, and how to store them in memory. we'll also need to define methods for adding and removing nodes and edges, as well as for                                         querying the graph.

 3. **Implement the layout algorithms:-**
                                Graphnet supports various layout algorithms for positioning nodes and edges, such as force-directed, circular, and random layouts. We'll                                 need to implement these algorithms and integrate them with the graph data structure.

 4. **Implement the visualization component:-**
              Once wehave the graph data structure and layout algorithms implemented, we'll need create a visualization component that renders                                 the graph on a web page. This will involve using React to create components for nodes and edges, and positioning them based on the layout                                  algorithm.

 5. **Test and debug:-**
                      As with any software project, we'll need to thoroughly test and debug your library to ensure it works correctly and is free from bugs and errors.

6. **Publish the library:-**
                    Once we're confident that your library is ready for use, you can publish it to npm so that other developers can use it in their own projects.
